This was not a common Christmas present, definitely it was not socks neither slippers. But what could it be?\r\n\
Rui started to ripoff the wrappig paper and quickly this box started to reveal itself.\r\n\
He wished this present for months, is he really seeing it right?\r\n\
Quickly after the furious unwrapping, that box was revealed. A tear was dropped, this was the happiest day to Rui Tinto, a brand new IBM PERSONAL SYSTEM/2 MODEL 30-001. This is the most recent computer from IBM, it has an Intel 8086 running at 8MHz, 3.5-inch 720Kb diskette, 640Kb of ram and 20Mb of HDD.\r\n\
Now with 18 years old Rui Tinto always remember this day, the hours spent playing Gorillas, programming BASIC and talking with random people on BSS.\r\n\
At the time Rui already had some hacking skills, like DOSing users with windows con/con trick, nuking friends on IRC, or disconnecting internet users with ping of death.\r\n\
Playing legal was never an option, inspired by Captain Crunch research, paying for internet was out of question, blue box at the time permitted to use international phone numbers to connect the internet.\r\n";
